## Introduction


This repository contains assignments I designed for the "Programming for Data Science" course as the Teaching Assistant at UT Dallas in Spring 2026.

These assignments cover a wide range of topics in programming for data science and analytics, including Python syntax, data handling, data visualization, and the implementation of basic machine learning models. All assignments are designed to be completed using Jupyter Notebooks.
